# Computational Modeling from Scratch

This repo is a work in progress and includes scripts I've found useful for getting the hang of modeling learning and decision making behavior: 

-   how to simulate data 
-   how to compute likelihood 
-   how to fit parameters
-   different ways to compare models
-   how to produce confusion matrices
